Welcome to RSI entrance challenge !
Computer Vision Task :

Step1: detect and decode qrcode image (You have to correct prespective view of qrcode and change the view angle to bird-eye view before decoding! )

Step2: after decoding you will have a number that you have to use it for the image that you should open it based on that number and 
       classify what is the exact object inside that image , is it a giraffe, a lion, or a human ?

wish you luck!
feel free to use pretrained models but keep the efficiency!
Always ask questions if you need to.
See you at RSI :)
